# Nova Systems

**Nova** is an intelligent backend system for modern service-based businesses and founders.  

It’s a customisable set of automations, decision trees, and workflows that:

- Capture leads across platforms automatically  
- Qualify prospects using AI  
- Assign and guide leads into pipelines  
- Trigger nurturing, onboarding, or follow-up sequences  
- Sync across your CRM, email, SMS, and task managers  
- Provide visibility and predictability across the whole growth funnel

## Who is Nova built for?

Founders who are tired of duct-taping tools. People who’ve got a growing business but no real *“system underneath”*.  

Nova is perfect for:

- Agencies  
- Consultants  
- Coaches  
- B2B service firms  
- Boutique SaaS founders  
- New-age studios  

---

They want to scale, but every next client feels like chaos. They waste hours assigning tasks, following up, chasing leads, and rebuilding manual flows.

> **NOVA ENDS THAT**  
> *Not with a dashboard, but with peace.*
